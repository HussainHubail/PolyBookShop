Abstract
The abstract should present a brief summary of the project document, stating the purpose, the methodology followed, the results, and any conclusions. Your abstract should be around 150 and 200 words. However, do not worry about the word count; instead make sure that your abstract briefly captures the information described above and allows the reader a first understanding about the project document. Nobody will complain to you about the total number of words, but your supervisor or your client will raise a concern about your abstract if it does not communicate all the necessary information. Leave the abstract as the last item. Write it after you finish the rest of your report, so that you have a solid understanding about the project.

Acknowledgements
You should add acknowledgements to any person you believe gave you support during this project (supervisor, clients, family, friends, etc).
